# Cortex sends inputs to analyzers and receives reports back via a
# persistent volume it shares with the jobs. These are the parameters
# for that filesystem. It's created with the ReadWriteMany access
# mode, which tells the cluster that both the Cortex pod and the
# analyzer/responder job pod will need to be able both to read and
# write this volume. Far fewer storage drivers support this mode than
# ReadWriteOnce, but at least one should support you. You may have to
# manually create the PersistentVolume that backs this claim.
